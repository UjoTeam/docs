# Registration

## Deprecated 2018/1018

For our architecture, we've moved to simply signing metadata registrations and not publishing them to the blockchain. In the future we will open this up into a decentralized database such as orbitDB or GUN.

## Pub/Sub Registry

This contract is responsible for parsing & logging metadata events in Ujo to the Ethereum blockchain.
