### Uport

uPort is an interoperable identity network for a secure, private, decentralized web. uPort provides open protocols for decentralized identity and interoperable messaging that enable trusted source attribution for all web communication. By allowing message recipients to trust message senders without centralized servers, we can create an entirely new framework for building applications.
